# Python Psych Experiment library

Trying to work on an alternative to PsychoPy.

## Why?

* Use Python 3, more up-to-date
* See about writing it more functionally (as opposed to OO), for efficiency and
readability of code, and to match the experiment logic a little better
* Know what's going on behind the scenes instead of trusting someone else's library
* Observe Pythonic style/PEP8
* Give people another option for experiment development software
